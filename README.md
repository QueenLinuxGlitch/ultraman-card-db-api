# ULTRMAN Card Game Database

![ULTRAMAN Card Game logo](./logo_ucg.png)

## Scraped from the Official Cardlist at https://ultraman-cardgame.com/page/us/card/card-list

### Last manual run: 6/1/25

The two scripts, [card-db-api.py](./card-db-api.py) and [card-db-meta.py](card-db-meta.py) output two sets of data, arguably one being more interesting than the other. The 'api' file will output the entire ULTRAMAN card catalog, promos and all into [this csv](./ultraman_cards.csv), and the 'meta' file will output additional data like different sets, types, grades, e.g. into different CSVs.

Have fun, Buddies! Build something cool with it!

### Github Pages [Webapp](https://queenlinuxglitch.github.io/ultraman-card-db-api/)

Notes from building the webapp: Their image API is slow as hell and loves to just not be responsive, so there's lazy-loading to compensate, but it will likely not load some images, you may have very good luck when you run the query, either way, you can use the info to build your own!

Dedicated to the Buddy who got me into ULTRAMAN ;)
