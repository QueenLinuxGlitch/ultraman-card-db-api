# ULTRMAN Card Game Database

![ULTRAMAN Card Game logo](./logo_ucg.png)

## Scraped from the Official Cardlist at https://ultraman-cardgame.com/page/us/card/card-list

The two scripts, [card-db-api.py](./card-db-api.py) and [card-db-meta.py](card-db-meta.py) output two sets of data, arguably one being more interesting than the other. The 'api' file will output the entire ULTRAMAN card catalog, promos and all into [this csv](./ultraman_cards.csv), and the 'meta' file will output additional data like different sets, types, grades, e.g. into different CSVs.

Have fun, Buddies! Build something cool with it, before I do.
